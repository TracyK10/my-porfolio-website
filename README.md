## Description
The portfolio webpage crafted serves as a showcase for myself, a proficient software engineer. Organized into sections such as "Home," "About Me," "Education," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact Me," it features a user-friendly navigation bar at the top. With meticulous CSS styling, I have curated an aesthetically pleasing layout, employing carefully selected colors, fonts, and spacing to effectively convey my professional journey. Each section offers insights into my background, skills, education, projects, and contact details, presented in a clear and structured manner. Additionally, smooth scrolling functionality has been implemented to facilitate seamless navigation between sections, enhancing the overall user experience for visitors to this portfolio.
